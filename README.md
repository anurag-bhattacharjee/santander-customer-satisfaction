# santander-customer-satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.  Santander Bank wanted to identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.  In this competition, we have worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.  Tools and Libraries Used: Python, Scikit learn, MatplotLib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Decision Trees
